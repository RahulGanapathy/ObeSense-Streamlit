**ObeSense-Streamlit**

**Description:**
ObeSense is a predictive model built using RandomForestClassifier to classify obesity levels into five categories: "Underweight", "Normal Weight", "Obesity Level 1", "Obesity Level 2", and "Obesity Level 3". This project integrates a Streamlit application for serving predictions. Additionally, the application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and management.

It is recommended to use Python version 3.11.9
